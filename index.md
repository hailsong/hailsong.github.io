**Nice to meet you!** I'm Hail Song, a Ph.D. candidate at [KAIST UVRlab](https://uvrlab.org/)  
and a researcher in AR/VR, Computer Vision, and Computer Graphics.

My research focuses on **reconstructing human avatars from visual data**, with a strong interest in making avatar creation efficient and accessible for real-time AR/VR communication and the metaverse.

Previously, I worked as a computer vision engineer at InBody, and I have experience with systems-level development in C++, Python, and AR/VR pipelines.

I am passionate about bridging the gap between research and application — from efficient 3D avatar generation to immersive interaction in extended reality (XR) environments.
