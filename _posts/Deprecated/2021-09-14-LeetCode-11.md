### ❓ 문제

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

 

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?

### Given Code

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        
```

### 내 풀이

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: list) -> int:
        length = [1] * len(nums)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    length[i] = max(length[i], length[j] + 1)
        # print(nums)
        # print(length)
        return(max(length))
```

왜 1트성공?? ㅎㅎㅎㅎ
