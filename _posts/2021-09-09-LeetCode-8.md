### ❓ 문제

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return *the reordered list*.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/10/oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == `number of nodes in the linked list
- `0 <= n <= 104`
- `-106 <= Node.val <= 106`

### Given Code

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        
```

### 내 풀이

```python
class Solution:
    def oddEvenList(self, head):

        odd = None
        even = None

        idx = 0
        tmp = head
        while(tmp != None):
            if idx % 2 == 0:
                odd = ListNode(tmp.val, odd)
            elif idx % 2 == 1:
                even = ListNode(tmp.val, even)
            tmp = tmp.next
            idx += 1

        res = None
        while(even != None):
            res = ListNode(even.val, res)
            even = even.next
        while(odd != None):
            res = ListNode(odd.val, res)
            odd = odd.next

        return res
```
